# Breast Cancer Classification Assignment

## Overview

This assignment will build and evaluate three different machine learning classification models to predict breast cancer using the built-in breast cancer dataset from Scikit-Learn. The models used in this assigment are:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The goal is to determine which model performs the best based on different evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this assignment is the breast cancer dataset provided by Scikit-Learn. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
